Problem
You're given the three angles a, b, and c respectively. Now check if these three angles can form a valid triangle with 
an area greater than 0 or not. Print "YES"(without quotes) if it can form a valid triangle with an area greater than 0, 
otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

###Input:

First-line will contain three numbers a, b, and c separated by space.
###Output: Print "YES"(without quotes) if these sides can form a valid triangle, otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

# CODE

list1 = list(map(str, input().split()))

a = int(list1[0])
b = int(list1[1])
c = int(list1[2])

if((a+b+c == 180) and a > 0 and b > 0 and c > 0):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
